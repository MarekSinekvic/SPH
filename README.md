_Navier Stokes equation_  

SPH equation is used as substitution for terms of Navier stokes. And then formulated some numerical solution like Projection method.  
Method have lot of advantages
* Easily to induce with other differential equations
* Mass conservation is granted by the method itself  
* Big advantage in simulating on complex boundaries
* ...
